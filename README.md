## How to Play
When starting the game, your task is to enter the house and then the hallway. Once in the hallway, you must navigate through the maze to find the exit. There is a second level that is a bit more challenging due to the lack of light.

## Known issues
- The controllers shown in game don't exaclty match the position of the player's hands.
- The portal effect for the hallway is not perfect and you may expereince a slight flicker when transitioning between the house and the hallway. The portal may also fail to teleport you sometimes. If this happens, simply walk through the portal again.
